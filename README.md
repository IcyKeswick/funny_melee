Funny Melee is a gameplay overhaul mod for Super Smash Bros. Melee inspired by Alpharad's Silly Melee that aims to make every character broken, but in a way that allows for fun matches at all levels.  
Additionally, several mechanics have been altered to make Melee more accessible and even more fast-paced.
